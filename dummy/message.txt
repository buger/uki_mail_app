Hello. My name is Vladimir Kolesnikov. 
And I'm the developer of ukijs framework. Ukijs matured and I put it to the test.
The idea was to replicate Mac Mail.app core experience in the browser 
with as much attention to details as possible and acceptable performance.

The whole thing took me about 15 hours. Which includes
building custom views, layouts, models, dummy server and deployment.
This is particularly exciting since it means that you can make a  
desktop-class app in less than a week, on your own.

<object width="600" height="375"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=10677818&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=10677818&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="600" height="375"></embed></object><p><a href="http://vimeo.com/10677818">Web prototype of Mail.app</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user657918">Volodya Kolesnikov</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

You can see it now. Select messages in the list. Drag and drop them to a folder.
And if your browser supports it you can even drop the messages on your desktop.


Apple is praised for attention to details. And there's plenty of them in the Mail.app.
I replicated some of them. Examples:
– resize date column and see how its contents changes
– move the vertical split pane and see how the buttons on the toolbar react.


NB: This is a demo. Not a fully functionally app. It is intended to show what you
browser is capable of. So try it out. And if you're a web-developer go to 
ukijs.org and start hacking. Code is free and open-source.
