Hello. My name is Vladimir Kolesnikov. 
And I'm the developer of ukijs framework. Ukijs matured and I put it to the test.
The idea was to replicate mac Mail.app core experience in the browser 
with as much attention to details as possible and acceptable performance.

The whole thing took me about 15 hours. Which includes everything from
building custom views, layouts, models, dummy server and deployment.
This is particularly exciting since it means that you can make a full 
desktop experience in less than a week, on your own.

You can see it now. Select messages in the list. Drag and drop them to a folder.
And if your browser supports it you can even drop the messages on your desktop.

When I tell about details I mean thins like this:
– resize date column and see how its contents changes
– move the vertical split pane and see how the buttons on the toolbar react.

So try it out. And if you're a web-developer go to ukijs.org and start hacking.
Everything is free and open-source.
