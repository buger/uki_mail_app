Hello. My name is Vladimir Kolesnikov. 
I'm the developer of <a href="http://ukijs.org">ukijs framework</a>. 
The framework matured and I put it to the test. 
The idea for the test was to replicate Mac Mail.app core experience in the browser.
With as much attention to details as possible and acceptable performance.

The whole thing took me about 15 hours. Which includes
building both client and dummy server. 
This is particularly exciting since it means that you can make a  
desktop-class app in less than a week.

See the video ^. Select messages in the list. Drag and drop them to a folder.
And if your browser supports it you can even drop the messages on your desktop.


Apple is praised for attention to details. And there's plenty of those in the real Mail.app.
I replicated some of them. Examples:
– resize date column and see how its contents changes
– move the vertical split pane and see how the buttons on the toolbar react.


NB: This is a demo. Not a fully functionally app. It is intended to show what you
browser is capable of. So try it out. If you're a web-developer then go to 
<a href="http://ukijs.org">ukijs.org</a> and start hacking. Code is free and open-source.
